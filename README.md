## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project aims to help organizations such as **banks**, **e-commerce platforms**, and **payment gateways** detect fraudulent transactions with high precision and transparency.

The system provides both **manual** and **CSV-based** transaction inputs and classifies transactions based on their risk probability into:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Low**
- ðŸŸ¡ **Medium**
- ðŸ”´ **High**
- âš« **Critical**
